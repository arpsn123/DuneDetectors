## Overview
This project implements multiclass image segmentation using the U-Net architecture, specifically designed for the Sandstone dataset. The goal is to accurately segment different classes within sandstone images to enhance analysis and interpretation. This project is ideal for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision and geology, looking to automate the segmentation of geological formations.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: Utilizes the powerful U-Net model, which excels in biomedical image segmentation, and adapts it for sandstone images.
- **Multiclass Segmentation**: Capable of segmenting multiple classes within the dataset, allowing for comprehensive analysis of geological structures.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: The project includes Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation, enabling users to visualize each step of the segmentation process.
- **Visual Results**: Comprehensive visualization of predictions, showcasing model performance with side-by-side comparisons of input images and their corresponding segmentation masks.
- **Customizable Training**: Allows for easy adjustment of hyperparameters and training configurations to suit different use cases.

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the segmentation model.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries used for building, training, and evaluating the U-Net model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, enabling the display of results and model predictions.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation, particularly in dataset preparation.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks, enhancing image loading and preprocessing steps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and preprocess the Sandstone dataset to ensure it is suitable for training. This includes normalization and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Architecture**: Define the U-Net architecture, which includes encoder and decoder paths, ensuring that spatial features are preserved through skip connections.
3. **Model Training**: Train the U-Net model using the prepared dataset, applying techniques such as early stopping and model checkpointing to optimize training.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, and pixel accuracy to ensure robust results.
5. **Prediction and Visualization**: Use the trained model to segment new images and visualize results, including overlays of segmentation masks on original images.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arpsn123/Sandstone_Image_Multiclass-Segmentation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sandstone_Image_Multiclass-Segmentation
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Multiclass_Image_Segmentation_using_Unet_Sandstone_Dataset.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
- Launch the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to execute the code and view results.
- Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs within the notebook to experiment with different configurations and visualize outcomes.
- Explore the sections of the notebook that detail model training, evaluation, and prediction to understand each part of the process.

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved Data Augmentation**: Implement advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, translations, flips) to enhance model robustness and generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore the use of libraries like Optuna or Keras Tuner to systematically search for optimal hyperparameters.
- **Integration with Other Models**: Evaluate and compare the U-Net model with other segmentation architectures such as DeepLab or Mask R-CNN for improved performance.
- **User Interface**: Develop a simple web interface using Flask or Streamlit for easier interaction with the segmentation model, allowing users to upload images and receive segmentation results.
